**Course Title: Introduction to Python Arrays for Beginners**

**Course Duration: 20 minutes**

**Course Overview:**
This course aims to introduce students with no programming background to the concept of arrays in Python. Arrays are fundamental data structures used to store and manipulate collections of elements. By the end of this course, students will understand what arrays are, how to create and manipulate them in Python, and some basic operations and methods associated with arrays.

**Course Outline:**

**1. Introduction to Arrays (5 minutes)**
   - Explanation of what arrays are and why they are important in programming.
   - Simple real-world examples to illustrate the concept of arrays.
   - Different types of arrays and their applications.

**2. Creating Arrays in Python (5 minutes)**
   - Introduction to the `array` module in Python.
   - Demonstration of how to create arrays using the `array` module.
   - Explanation of different types of arrays (e.g., numeric arrays, character arrays).

**3. Accessing and Modifying Array Elements (5 minutes)**
   - Basic indexing and slicing of arrays.
   - Demonstration of how to access and modify individual elements of an array.
   - Example scenarios to illustrate the importance of array manipulation.

**4. Basic Operations and Methods (3 minutes)**
   - Introduction to common array operations such as adding elements, removing elements, and finding the length of an array.
   - Demonstration of built-in methods like `append()`, `remove()`, and `len()`.

**5. Practical Examples (2 minutes)**
   - Simple coding examples to reinforce understanding.
   - Exercises for students to practice creating and manipulating arrays.
   - Q&A session to address any queries or concerns.

**6. Conclusion (1 minute)**
   - Summary of key points covered in the course.
   - Encouragement for further exploration and practice with arrays in Python.
   - Resources for additional learning.

**Note:** The course outline is designed to provide a concise yet comprehensive introduction to arrays in Python within a 20-minute timeframe. Depending on the pace of the class and the level of engagement, the instructor may adjust the duration of each section or include additional examples and exercises.
